# Checks if it can connection to the internet
# by trying to resolve a hostname to an ip
# It should be faster than pinging a server
# I couldn't think of a faster way than dsn resolve
# 
# Example:
#   >> InternetConnection.on?  => true
#   >> InternetConnection.off? => false
# 
# If using ruby 1.9 with eventmachine please install
# em-resolv-replace gem for evented thread save resolvs
